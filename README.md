## Hey Day at Auburn University
Hey! Auburn University has a tradition that they do annually called "Hey Day." It is a super fun way for students to get involved and meet a bunch of other students that they have never met before. It is an interactive day where people are spread out in the student green space and on the concourse and wear name tags and hand out little promotional items like water bottles and stickers. Sometimes for Hey Day they include food and/or set up games. It's a great way to encourage the students, faculty, and anyone else on campus to interact with one another and be friendly! There's a lot of history that goes into why they created "Hey Day" and you can check it out on this link: http://sga.auburn.edu/hey-day/
## Motivation
I am participating in this activity for my class to share information about my school's "Hey Day" because I think this was a great idea to do this event every year. It's a tradition that promotes a positive atmosphere where people are friendly and can feel loved, all while meeting new people at the same time. It can also push people out of their comfort zone, which can lead personal growth and other positive aspects for their lives. I have made a short but fun working script about Hey Day, I hope you enjoy!
